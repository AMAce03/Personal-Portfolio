# Personal-Portfolio

### Overview:

The purpose of this project is to create a personal portfolio that I can use to show my skills and experiences. The project utilises html for the creation of the website and css for the styling. It includes a short bio, interests and education sections. Work and volunteer experiences, as well as my current and previous projects. The website is also hosted on github pages.

### Tech Stack:

The tech stack used during the creation of this website was iterative. Each section was added on as a new feature with testing done in between. The reason I chose this tech stack is that it allows for adequate testing, and minimizes the amount of bugs I will have to fix before deployment after implementing all the features. It also allows me to easily keep track of progress of the work done, and how much work was left to be done.

### License Choice:

I decided to go with the MIT License because of its simplicity. It also allows for a user to use my work as long as i am attributed.
